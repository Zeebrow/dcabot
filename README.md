# DCABOT
I'm sick and tired of getting ass-blasted by fees from all of the different crypto apps. 
$1.00 fee on a $5.00 order in the Gemini app! Ridiculous!

Meanwhile, Gemini API charges a taker fee of 0.35% - That's $0.0175. And that's the highest the fee goes. Wow.

## Plan
- Use bot to daily buy $X of crypto
- Periodically add USD from bank
	- Simultaneously move same amount of crypto to hardware wallet if tx fees are acceptable
- Track changes to crypto balance
